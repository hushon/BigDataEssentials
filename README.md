# Big Data Analysis Algorithms
## Introduction

In this repository you will find common algorithms used in big data analytics. The examples refer to the problems in Stanford's CS246 course.  
Codes are written in Python, and some utilize Apache Spark API to leverage parallelism in the workloads.  

## Requirements

 - Python 2.7
 - Apache Spark 3.6
 - NumPy

## Algorithms
*\*Items marked require Apache Spark.*

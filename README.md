# Big Data Analysis Algorithms
## Introduction

In this repository you will find common algorithms used in big data analytics. The examples refer to the problems in Stanford's CS246 course.  
Codes are written in Python, and some utilize Apache Spark API to leverage parallelism in the workloads.  

## Requirements

 - Python 2.7
 - Apache Spark 3.6
 - NumPy

## Algorithms
| No | Description | Spark |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Friend recommendation based on counting mutual friends | ✔️ |
| 2 | A-priori Algorithm: mining frequent item pairs from baskets |  |
| 3 | Locality-sensitive Hashing: mining similar documents |  |
| 4 | K-means Clustering | ✔️ |
| 5 | Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis, CUR decomposition |  |
| 6 | Collaborative Filtering: predicting user rating by finding similar users |  |
| 7 | PageRank | ✔️ |
| 8 | Girvan-Newman Algorithm: mining communities in a social-network graph | ✔️ |
| 9 | Support Vector Machine |  |
| 10 | Deep Learning |  |
| 11 | DGIM algorithm: mining continuous stream of data |  |

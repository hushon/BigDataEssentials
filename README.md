# Big Data Analysis Algorithms
## Introduction

In this repository you will find common algorithms used in big data analytics. Implementations are written in Python and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).  
The problems are from the homeworks in Stanford CS246 course.

## Requirements

 - Python 2.7
 - Apache Spark 3.6

## Algorithms

1. Friend recommendation based on count of mutual friends.
2. A-priori Algorithm: mining frequent item pairs from baskets.
3. Locality-sensitive Hashing: mining similar documents.
4. K-means Clustering
5. Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis, CUR decomposition
6. Collaborative Filtering: predicting rating and recommendation.
7. PageRank
8. Girvan-Newman Algorithm: mining communities in a social-network graph.
9. Support Vector Machine
10. Deep Learning
11. DGIM algorithm: mining continuous stream of data.
